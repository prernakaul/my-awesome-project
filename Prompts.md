NPM Install Command

npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code

New App Prompt

Make a chore app to manage chores at the office. It should
  - Show a calendar view like Outlook to see all our current chores
  - Allow adding/removing chores
  - Be able to make chores recurring on a schedule
  - Assign chores to team members
  - Add/remove team members

Ask me questions to clarify the product requirements, technical requirements, engineering principles, and hard constraints.

CLAUDE.md Prompt

Analyze this codebase and create a CLAUDE.md file following these principles:

1. Keep it under 150 lines total - focus only on universally applicable information
2. Cover the essentials: WHAT (tech stack, project structure), WHY (purpose), and HOW (build/test commands)
3. Use Progressive Disclosure: instead of including all instructions, create a brief index pointing to other markdown files in .claude/docs/ for specialized topics
4. Include file:line references instead of code snippets
5. Assume I'll use linters for code style - don't include formatting guidelines

Structure it as: project overview, tech stack, key directories/their purposes, essential build/test commands, and a list of additional documentation files Claude should check when relevant.

Additionally, extract patterns you observe into separate files:
- .claude/docs/architectural_patterns.md - document the architectural patterns, design decisions, and conventions used (e.g., dependency injection, state management, API design patterns). Make sure these are patterns that appear in multiple files.

Reference these files in the CLAUDE.md's "Additional Documentation" section.

Bug Fix

Bug fix: when the user clicks on the calendar in weekly view to add a new chore, the time of the new chore doesn’t reflect the cell the user clicked.

Architecture Changes

Architecture change: Chore changes (add chore, remove chore, change chore) should sync in real time to other clients. For example, if we make the change on one browser it should happen on all other tabs. Read the files related to calendar display to determine 3 options to move forward.
